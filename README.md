This was not a casual walk.

## Execution

- Pace remained steady and controlled
- Focus maintained on breathing and posture

## Observation
- Heart rate stabilized progressively
- Muscular tension reduced during movement
- Mental state transitioned from execution to recovery

## Principle Applied

- Recovery is an active process
- Every action must have a defined purpose
- Guidance respected over impulse

## Notes
This walk is treated as part of the training session,
not as a separate or optional activity.
